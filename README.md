Google Closure is a set of JavaScript tools, that Google uses to build many of their core products. It provides:

- A JavaScript Optimizer to build a distributable version of your application
- A comprehensive JavaScript library
- A templating system for JavaScript
- A JavaScript style checker and style fixer
- An enhanced stylesheet language that works with the optimizer to minifiy CSS.
- Each one of these components is agnostic of the other. Closure is at the heart of building products with prestans.

Google Closure is unlike other JavaScript frameworks (e.g jQuery). An extremely central part of Closure tools is itâ€™s compiler (which is not just a minifier), the Closure development philosophy is to use the abstractions and components made available by Closure library and allow the compiler to optimise it for production.
